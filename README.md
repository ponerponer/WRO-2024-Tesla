Our project involves creating three AI-controlled robots using high-quality robotics kits. These robots operate autonomously, making decisions based on the AI algorithms integrated into the system. By using robotics kits, we are able to focus on enhancing the AI's performance and optimizing the robots' interactions with their surroundings.
